# What we offer estate agents on ConnectHouses
ConnectHouses works with real estate agents from all across Europe. We offer an online platform for agents to promote their properties. This can be especially valuable for agents that want to avoid the technical aspects of online marketing. Our platform is developed for easy installation and integration with any real estate software.

The ConnectHouses website has a management dashboard for registered agents. The dashboard can be used to create, edit or delete real estate properties. Property management can also be automated, our system supports synchronisation with any data feed. Synchronisation is supported for commonly used data formats, but also custom formats that require a mapping to our system.
